Introduction
==================

Mojo-grasp is a framework that aims to make grasping simulations faster and easier to implement in pybullet. It offers helper functions, project
templates, a state machine and Reinforcement learning support. It helps you get started with projects faster, and provides structure. This is 
an ongoing effort, so broad changes may still happen.

Installation
==================

After cloning repository run:

``pip3 install -e .``

This will install mojo-grasp as well as pybullet.

Usage
==================

We recommend that you begin by looking through the two demos on the github to get a general sense of how a project is structured, 
and the pieces that you will need. We also provide a project template that can be found here: `Project Template Repo <https://github.com/OSUrobotics/mojo-grasp-project-template>`_
